# Introduction
Welcome everyone to my repository! This is where I build the mathematical foundation for Machine Learning. In this repository, there are three core mathematics topics for [Machine Learning](https://github.com/VuongMinhTuan/Machine-Learning/blob/master) preparation:

1. [Linear Algebra](https://github.com/VuongMinhTuan/Linear-Algebra)
2. [Probability and Statistics](https://github.com/VuongMinhTuan/Probability-Statistics)
3. [Calculus](https://github.com/VuongMinhTuan/Calculus)

If you have any questions or would like to contribute ideas, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out and discuss with [me](https://github.com/VuongMinhTuan/VuongMinhTuan).

Thank you, and happy learning!
